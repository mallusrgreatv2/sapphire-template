# TypeScript Sapphire Bot example

This is a basic setup of a Discord bot using the [sapphire framework](https://sapphirejs.dev) written in TypeScript

Based on [with-tsup example](https://github.com/sapphiredev/examples/tree/main/examples/with-tsup)

## How to use it?

### Prerequisite

```sh
yarn install
```

### Development

You can run the code in watch mode by running `yarn dev` to automatically restart your bot in case of any file changes.

### Production

You can use the shorthand `yarn start` which builds the files and starts the bot.
